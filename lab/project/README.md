## Project objectives

The objective of the project within the subject Digital electronics was to create PWM sound generation of basic signals. We used these components. Nexys A7 board to conotrol all other parts, led bargraph to signalize the distance, piezo buzzer with PWM modulation for sound signalization, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance. The sensor measures a distance from 2 cm to 4 m, but for our purpose we used only measurements up to 1m. The codes, testbenches and simulations are created in Vivado. Models and designes of boards are created in Autodesk EAGLE.
